              | using decorators and compiler-emitted type info to
              | generate models from regular classes, with a shallow
              | learning curve for building new validators. This allowed
              | sharing models between front-end and back-end, effectively
              | halving validation effort. Taught Angular 2 to team,
              | co-led front-end development.
